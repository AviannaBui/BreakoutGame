# Breakout Game
###### Author: Avianna Bui

## Game Description
This program recreates the classic Breakout arcade, initially developed in 1976 by Steve Wozniak, in which players aim to clear rows of bricks by hitting them with a bouncing ball using a paddle. 
The code requires users to install Java 17 in order to use kilt-graphics, a graphic library developed by the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS) department in Macalester College: https://mac-comp127.github.io/kilt-graphics/index.html. The game was coded as a class assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming and Abstraction course created by Macalester's MSCS department, under the guidance of Paul Cantrell, my course instructor, and the preceptors for the class. 

## Game Instructions
The objective of the game is to remove the bricks from the screen by hitting them with a ball. To do so, players would slide their keyboard’s mouse left and right to control the direction of the paddle. When the ball hits the surface of the paddle or the wall, it would bounce back and strike down the bricks. The player wins when all the bricks disappear from the screen. 
The player loses a life when the paddle misses the ball. Failure to eliminate all the bricks before the players lose a total of 3 lives results in a loss. 

## Known Issues 
Due to the limitations of the graphic library being used, players might encounter issues with screen lagging if they move the paddle too quickly. 

## Societal Impact
Playing the game requires the use of a mouse. As a result, the program is only practicable to people who use mouse-controlling devices while remaining inaccessible to those who use other assistive devices. In addition, while this doesn’t necessarily impact the ability of users to play the game, I recognize that the color themes use might not be color-blind friendly to certain users.
